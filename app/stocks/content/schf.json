Launched by Charles Schwab Investment Management, it aims to offer investors a diversified portfolio of large- and mid-cap companies from developed markets around the globe. The ETF includes thousands of stocks from various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and consumer goods, allowing investors to benefit from global economic growth. With a low expense ratio, SCHF is designed to be a cost-effective way for investors to gain access to non-U.S. equity markets. The fund's investment strategy emphasizes transparency, liquidity, and tax efficiency, making it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios. As part of Schwab's commitment to providing investors with tools and resources, SCHF is supported by a robust platform that includes educational materials and investment insights. The ETF represents a strategic way for investors to engage with the global economy and hedge against U.S.-centric risks, as international markets can behave differently than domestic ones.
