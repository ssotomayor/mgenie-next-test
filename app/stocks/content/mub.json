    "description": "The iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of investment-grade U.S. municipal bonds. Launched in 2007, MUB is designed for investors looking for income that is exempt from federal taxes, making it an appealing choice for those in higher tax brackets. The fund primarily invests in bonds issued by U.S. municipalities, which can include states, cities, and counties, and focuses on bonds with high credit ratings, ensuring a degree of safety for its investors. MUB provides exposure to a broad range of municipal securities, allowing investors to diversify their fixed-income portfolios while benefiting from the potential tax advantages that municipal bonds offer. The ETF has become popular among income-focused investors due to its relatively low expense ratio, high liquidity, and the ability to trade on major stock exchanges. As interest rates fluctuate, MUB may appeal to those seeking stable income in a tax-efficient manner, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. Overall, MUB serves as a convenient vehicle for investors looking to gain exposure to the municipal bond market without having to purchase individual bonds.",
