    "description": "ProShares Short MSCI EAFE (EFZ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that provides investors with the opportunity to gain inverse exposure to the performance of the MSCI EAFE Index. The index includes large- and mid-cap equities across developed markets outside the United States and Canada, including Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Far East. Launched by ProShares in 2008, EFZ is designed for investors looking to hedge against market downturns or to speculate on declines in international equity markets. This fund is particularly appealing to those who believe that the stocks in the MSCI EAFE Index will underperform in the short term. EFZ seeks to deliver -1x the daily performance of the index, meaning that for every 1% decline in the index, EFZ aims to increase by approximately 1%. Investors should note that due to the compounding of daily returns, the performance of EFZ over longer periods may differ significantly from the inverse of the index\u2019s performance. The fund is managed by ProShares, a leader in leveraged and inverse ETFs, and has gained attention for its role in tactical asset allocation strategies. Through its unique structure, EFZ allows investors to diversify their portfolios and manage risk effectively in volatile market conditions.",
