    "description": "The Schwab U.S. Small-Cap Growth ETF (SCHJ) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index. This index includes small-cap stocks that exhibit growth characteristics, offering investors exposure to companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to their industry peers. Launched by Charles Schwab Investment Management in 2013, SCHJ provides an efficient way for investors to gain diversified access to small-cap growth stocks across various sectors of the economy. The ETF is designed for investors looking for long-term capital appreciation and who are comfortable with the inherent risks associated with investing in smaller companies. SCHJ employs a passive investment strategy, which means it aims to replicate the performance of its benchmark index by holding the same securities in proportion to their weights in the index. This approach typically results in lower management fees and expenses compared to actively managed funds. The ETF has gained popularity among investors seeking exposure to the growth potential of small-cap stocks while maintaining a focus on cost efficiency and diversification.",
