    "description": "The Schwab International Small-Cap Equity ETF (SCHC) is designed to provide investors with exposure to small-cap companies outside of the United States, specifically in developed markets. Launched in 2010 by Charles Schwab Investment Management, the ETF aims to track the performance of the FTSE Developed ex US Small Cap Index. This index includes a diverse range of small-cap stocks from various sectors, offering a broad representation of international small-cap equity markets. By investing in SCHC, investors can gain access to thousands of companies that may not be as widely covered by analysts and may offer growth potential not found in larger, more established firms. The fund emphasizes liquidity and cost efficiency, making it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios internationally. With its low expense ratio, SCHC is particularly appealing for those seeking to minimize investment costs while gaining broad exposure to small-cap equities. The ETF is managed with a focus on transparency and discipline, aligning with Schwab's commitment to providing accessible investment solutions. As global economies continue to evolve, SCHC provides a pathway for investors to capitalize on the potential growth of smaller companies on the international stage.",
