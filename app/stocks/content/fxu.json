This fund primarily invests in companies engaged in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, natural gas, and water. FXU offers a unique approach to investing in the utilities sector, utilizing a rules-based strategy to identify stocks that exhibit strong price momentum and fundamental growth, while also maintaining a focus on value.
