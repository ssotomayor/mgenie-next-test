    "description": "The Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund (HFRO) is a closed-end investment company that seeks to provide investors with high current income by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of floating rate senior loans. These loans are typically issued by corporate borrowers and are designed to provide stable income that adjusts with interest rate changes, making HFRO an attractive option for investors looking to hedge against rising interest rates. The fund aims to achieve its investment objective by focusing on loans that are secured by collateral and are often rated below investment grade, which may offer higher yields. Established in the wake of the financial crisis, HFRO leverages the expertise of Highland Capital Management, a firm known for its investment strategies in the credit markets. The fund's investment process is guided by rigorous credit analysis and risk management practices to identify opportunities that align with its income-focused strategy. In addition to loans, HFRO may invest in other debt instruments, including high yield bonds and structured products. As a closed-end fund, HFRO offers a fixed number of shares and trades on the stock exchange, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day. The fund's distribution policy aims to provide regular income to its shareholders, making it a suitable choice for income-seeking investors.",
