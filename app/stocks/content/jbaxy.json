Established in 2000, Jubilee specializes in platinum group metals (PGMs) and battery metals, utilizing innovative technologies to unlock value from previously overlooked resources. The company operates in South Africa and Zambia, where it has established several key processing plants, including the Windsor and Dilokong tailings projects.

By leveraging its proprietary technologies, Jubilee aims to enhance metal recovery rates, thereby maximizing returns for its investors while contributing to the circular economy. In addition to PGMs, Jubilee is increasingly involved in the recovery of cobalt and nickel, which are critical for battery production in the electric vehicle sector. With a strong growth strategy, Jubilee is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising demand for clean energy and sustainable resource management, making it an essential player in the transition to a greener future.",
