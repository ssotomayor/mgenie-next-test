    "description": "MicroSectors\u2122 FANG+\u2122 Index 2x Leveraged ETN (BULZ) is an exchange-traded note that seeks to provide investors with leveraged exposure to the performance of the FANG+ Index, which comprises a select group of high-growth technology and internet companies. The FANG+ Index includes well-known stocks such as Facebook (Meta Platforms), Amazon, Netflix, Google (Alphabet), and Apple, among others, reflecting the dynamics of the technology-driven market. Launched by the investment firm Innovator Capital Management, BULZ allows investors to gain magnified returns on a daily basis, aiming to double the performance of the underlying index. This product is designed for sophisticated investors who are looking for short-term trading opportunities rather than long-term investment, as the leveraged nature of the note means that it carries higher risks and volatility. BULZ offers a unique vehicle for investors to capitalize on the rapid growth of technology and internet companies, making it a popular choice during bullish market conditions.",
