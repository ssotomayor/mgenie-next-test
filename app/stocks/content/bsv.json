    "description": "Invesco BulletShares 2024 High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (BSV) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the BulletShares 2024 High Yield Corporate Bond Index. This ETF is designed for investors looking for a diversified portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds that will mature in 2024. The fund primarily invests in a range of corporate bonds that are rated below investment grade, reflecting higher risk but also the potential for higher returns. BSV is structured to reduce interest rate risk by having a defined maturity date, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors who want to understand their cash flow and risks. The fund's strategy focuses on maximizing total return while balancing the risk of default, and it offers a transparent and efficient way to gain access to the high yield bond market. Invesco, a global investment management firm, manages the ETF, providing strong expertise in fixed income investments. Investors can utilize BSV as part of a diversified investment strategy to enhance yield and manage interest rate risk in their portfolios.",
