    "description": "The Invesco Variable Rate Preferred ETF (VFL) is designed to provide investors with exposure to variable rate preferred securities, which typically offer higher yields than traditional fixed-rate preferreds. Launched in 2016, this exchange-traded fund aims to track the performance of the S&P Variable Rate Preferred Index. VFL invests primarily in preferred stocks that have a floating rate component, which adjusts periodically based on market conditions, making them an attractive option in rising interest rate environments. The fund's investment strategy focuses on a diversified portfolio of preferred securities across various sectors, including financials, utilities, and industrials, allowing investors to benefit from the income potential while mitigating interest rate risk. With a relatively low expense ratio compared to actively managed funds, VFL appeals to both individual and institutional investors seeking income generation and capital appreciation through a diversified approach to preferred securities. The ETF trades on major exchanges, providing liquidity and transparency, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions as needed. As part of Invesco's broad range of investment solutions, VFL is an excellent option for those looking to enhance yield and diversify their investment portfolio with a focus on preferred securities.",
