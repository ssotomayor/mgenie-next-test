    "description": "The Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (DWAS) is an exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with exposure to small-cap U.S. companies that exhibit value characteristics along with momentum factors. Launched in 2014, DWAS focuses on companies that are identified as undervalued based on various financial metrics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, while also emphasizing stocks that have demonstrated positive price momentum over a specified period. This strategic combination aims to capitalize on the potential for growth in the small-cap sector while managing risk through value-oriented investing. The fund tracks the S&P SmallCap 600\u00ae Value Index, which includes companies from the S&P SmallCap 600 that have been categorized as value stocks. The ETF is particularly appealing to investors seeking diversification within their portfolios, as small-cap stocks tend to respond differently to economic cycles compared to large-cap stocks. With its systematic approach to selecting investments, DWAS aims to deliver long-term capital appreciation while providing an opportunity for income generation through dividends. The fund is managed by Invesco, a global investment management firm known for its extensive range of investment products and commitment to helping investors achieve their financial goals.",
