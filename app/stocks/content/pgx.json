    "description": "Invesco Preferred ETF (PGX) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of preferred securities. Launched in 2008, PGX aims to track the performance of the ICE BofA US Preferred Stock Index, which includes a broad range of preferred stocks from various sectors. Preferred stocks are hybrid securities that combine features of both equity and debt, typically offering higher yields compared to common stocks and fixed income securities. Investors are drawn to PGX for its potential to deliver attractive income through dividends, as preferred stocks often pay fixed dividends that can be more stable than common stock dividends. The ETF provides a convenient way for investors to gain access to the preferred stock market without having to purchase individual securities. The fund is managed by Invesco, a global investment management firm known for its wide array of investment products. With a focus on income generation, PGX serves as an appealing option for income-oriented investors looking to diversify their portfolios with preferred securities.",
