    "description": "Isoray, Inc. is a medical technology company specializing in innovative cancer treatment solutions through the use of brachytherapy, a form of radiation therapy that involves placing radioactive sources directly into or near tumors. Founded in 2004, Isoray is best known for its proprietary technology that utilizes Cesium-131, a radioisotope that has been shown to provide a more effective and safer treatment option for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. The company's flagship product, the Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed, has gained recognition for its ability to deliver high doses of radiation directly to cancer cells while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissue. This targeted approach enhances treatment efficacy and reduces side effects compared to traditional radiation therapies. Isoray is committed to advancing the field of oncology with ongoing research and development efforts aimed at expanding its product offerings and improving patient outcomes. The company collaborates with healthcare providers and institutions to facilitate the adoption of its innovative therapies and to raise awareness about the benefits of brachytherapy. With a mission to improve the quality of life for cancer patients, Isoray continues to pioneer advancements in cancer treatment technology.",
