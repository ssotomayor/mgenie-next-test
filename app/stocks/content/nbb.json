    "description": "Nuveen Build America Bond Fund (NBB) is a closed-end fund that primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of Build America Bonds. These bonds are issued by municipalities to finance infrastructure projects and provide tax incentives to investors. The fund aims to provide high current income and capital appreciation by investing in these bonds, which typically offer higher yields compared to traditional municipal bonds due to the taxable nature of the interest income. NBB focuses on bonds with long maturities, and its portfolio is actively managed to optimize income while considering interest rate risks and credit quality. The fund is designed for investors seeking a steady income stream from fixed-income investments while benefiting from the potential growth of infrastructure developments across the United States. Nuveen, the fund's investment advisor, is known for its expertise in managing municipal bond portfolios, making NBB a compelling choice for income-focused investors looking to diversify their holdings with tax-exempt municipal securities.",
