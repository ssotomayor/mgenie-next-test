Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Scholar Rock utilizes its proprietary platform to develop targeted therapeutics that address the underlying biology of diseases. The company's lead product candidate, SRK-015, is designed to inhibit the activation of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, and is being investigated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
