    "description": "The Fidelity Low Duration Bond ETF (FLDR) is an exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of low-duration bonds. Launched by Fidelity Investments, a leading asset management firm, FLDR aims to deliver attractive yields with lower interest rate risk compared to longer-duration fixed income securities. The ETF primarily invests in high-quality, short- to intermediate-term government and corporate bonds, emphasizing bonds with maturities of less than three years. This investment strategy is particularly appealing during periods of rising interest rates, as shorter-duration bonds typically experience less price volatility compared to their longer-duration counterparts. By focusing on high credit quality and low duration, FLDR seeks to provide a stable income stream while preserving capital. The fund is managed by a team of experienced professionals at Fidelity, who employ rigorous research and analysis to select bonds that fit the fund's investment criteria. Additionally, FLDR offers liquidity and transparency typical of ETFs, allowing investors to trade shares on major stock exchanges like a stock. The fund aims to appeal to conservative investors seeking income while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations.",
