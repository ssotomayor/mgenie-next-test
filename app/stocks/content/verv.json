    "description": "Verve Therapeutics, Inc. is a pioneering biotechnology company focused on developing transformative medicines for cardiovascular disease through gene editing. Founded in 2018, Verve is harnessing the power of CRISPR technology to create one-time treatments that can provide lasting benefits for patients at risk of heart disease. The company's innovative approach aims to reduce cholesterol levels and other risk factors associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by permanently modifying genes involved in lipid metabolism. Verve's lead program targets a specific gene to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a major contributor to heart disease. By employing a unique in vivo gene editing strategy, Verve seeks to address the root causes of heart disease rather than merely treating symptoms. The company's mission is to redefine the treatment of cardiovascular disease and improve patient outcomes by offering a new class of therapies that are both effective and convenient. As the prevalence of heart disease continues to rise globally, Verve Therapeutics is at the forefront of a potential revolution in cardiovascular care, committed to making a meaningful impact on public health.",
