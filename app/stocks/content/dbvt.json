    "description": "DBV Technologies S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for food allergies. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Montrouge, France, DBV Technologies is dedicated to improving the quality of life for patients with food allergies, particularly peanut allergies, through its proprietary Viaskin technology. This technology utilizes a unique epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) approach, allowing for the delivery of therapeutic proteins through the skin, which aims to desensitize patients to allergens over time. The company's lead product candidate, Viaskin Peanut, is designed to treat peanut allergy in children and has shown promising results in clinical trials. DBV Technologies is also exploring additional applications of its technology for other food allergies and chronic conditions. The company's mission extends beyond product development; it aims to raise awareness about food allergies and contribute to the scientific understanding of these conditions. DBV Technologies is committed to conducting rigorous clinical research and collaborating with healthcare professionals and patient advocacy groups to ensure the best outcomes for patients.",
