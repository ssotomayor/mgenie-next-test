    "description": "ProShares UltraPro Short Russell2000 (URTY) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to deliver triple the inverse performance of the Russell 2000 Index, which is a benchmark for small-cap U.S. stocks. Launched in 2015, URTY aims to provide investors with an opportunity to capitalize on declines in the small-cap equity market by using derivatives and other financial instruments. This fund is particularly suitable for short-term traders and investors looking to hedge against market downturns, as it seeks to achieve its investment objective on a daily basis. The ETF employs leverage to amplify returns, making it a higher-risk investment strategy. URTY is managed by ProShares, a leader in the ETF industry known for its innovative products and strategies. The fund is traded on major stock exchanges and is popular among active traders who seek to profit from volatility in the small-cap sector. It is important for investors to understand the risks associated with leveraged and inverse ETFs, including the potential for significant losses in a volatile market, as these funds are intended for experienced investors who actively manage their positions.",
