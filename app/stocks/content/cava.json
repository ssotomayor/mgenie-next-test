    "description": "Cava Group, Inc. is a fast-casual restaurant chain that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine, offering a diverse menu inspired by traditional Mediterranean dishes. Founded in 2006 in Washington, D.C. by Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and his partners, Cava began as a single restaurant and has since expanded into a national brand with locations across the United States. The company prides itself on using high-quality, fresh ingredients and offers customizable bowls, pitas, and salads that cater to a variety of dietary preferences, including vegan and gluten-free options. Cava's commitment to sustainability is evident in its sourcing practices and community engagement, as the company works to support local farmers and promote healthy eating. The brand has gained popularity for its bold flavors and innovative dishes, such as the signature Cava Bowl, which features a base of grain or greens topped with a choice of proteins, dips, and sauces. In addition to its restaurant operations, Cava has also ventured into grocery products, making its popular dips and spreads available in retail stores. With a focus on growth and customer experience, Cava continues to innovate within the fast-casual dining space, aiming to redefine how people think about Mediterranean food.",
