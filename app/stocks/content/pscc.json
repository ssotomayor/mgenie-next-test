Launched in 2006, PSCC seeks to provide investors with exposure to small-cap consumer staples companies that are involved in the production and distribution of essential goods and services, such as food, beverages, household products, and personal care items. The ETF aims to deliver long-term capital appreciation while maintaining a level of risk that is consistent with small-cap investing. As part of the broader Invesco family, PSCC benefits from the firm's extensive experience in managing exchange-traded funds and its commitment to providing innovative investment solutions. The ETF is a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with exposure to smaller companies that are less correlated with the overall market, while still focusing on stable and consumer-driven sectors. By investing in PSCC, investors can gain access to a range of companies that are well-positioned to benefit from consumer demand, providing a strategic option for those seeking growth opportunities within the consumer staples arena.",
