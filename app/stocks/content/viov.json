    "description": "The Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF (VIOV) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Value Index. Founded in 2010 by Vanguard, one of the world's largest investment management companies, VIOV provides investors with exposure to small-cap companies that are considered value stocks. These are companies that are believed to be undervalued in the market and have the potential for long-term growth. The fund invests in a diversified portfolio of small-cap stocks, which can provide opportunities for capital appreciation and income generation. By focusing on value stocks, VIOV aims to capture the performance of companies with strong fundamentals, including low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, and solid balance sheets. As part of Vanguard's commitment to low-cost investing, VIOV offers an expense ratio that is significantly lower than the industry average, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. The ETF is designed for investors looking to add small-cap value exposure to their portfolios, balancing risk and return through diversification across multiple sectors, including financials, consumer discretionary, and industrials. With a focus on long-term investment strategies, VIOV serves as a valuable tool for those seeking capital growth and income through a diversified approach to small-cap investing.",
