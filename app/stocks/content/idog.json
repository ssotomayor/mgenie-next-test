    "description": "The Invesco S&P International Developed Quality ETF (IDOG) is designed to provide investors with exposure to high-quality companies in developed international markets. Launched in 2013, IDOG seeks to track the performance of the S&P International Developed Quality Index, which comprises stocks from developed markets excluding the United States and Canada. The fund focuses on companies that exhibit strong quality characteristics, including solid profitability, low financial leverage, and strong earnings stability. By concentrating on high-quality firms, IDOG aims to deliver better risk-adjusted returns over time compared to broad international equity indices. The ETF is particularly appealing to investors looking for a blend of growth and value in their international equity exposure, as it filters out lower-quality companies that may be more volatile. IDOG is managed by Invesco, a global investment management firm known for its wide range of ETFs and investment products. The fund's strategy is rooted in the belief that high-quality companies tend to outperform their peers over the long term, especially during market downturns. With a diversified portfolio of stocks across various sectors and countries, IDOG provides a convenient and cost-effective way for investors to access a selection of quality international companies, making it a suitable option for long-term investors seeking international diversification.",
