Established in 2007, ETW employs a tax-managed buy-write strategy on a diversified portfolio of common stocks, which allows it to generate income through option premiums while seeking to mitigate the impact of market volatility.

The fund is managed by Eaton Vance, a well-respected investment management firm with extensive experience in equity and fixed-income securities. ETW is particularly appealing to investors seeking tax-efficient income, as it aims to minimize tax liabilities on distributions.
