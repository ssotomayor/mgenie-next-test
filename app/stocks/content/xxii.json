Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Williamsville, New York, the company is dedicated to developing reduced-risk tobacco products and advancing the science of hemp and cannabis. 22nd Century Group has developed proprietary technology to manipulate the genetics of tobacco plants, allowing them to create products with significantly reduced levels of nicotine.

The company's flagship product line, VLN, is the first and only combustible cigarette with a non-addictive level of nicotine. In addition to its tobacco initiatives, 22nd Century Group is also exploring the potential of hemp and cannabis-derived products, focusing on high-value plant and agricultural applications. With a commitment to scientific research and consumer safety, the company is at the forefront of the evolving landscape of tobacco regulation and plant-based therapeutics. As public awareness of the health impacts of smoking increases, 22nd Century Group positions itself as a key player in the effort to innovate and transform the tobacco industry while promoting healthier alternatives.",
