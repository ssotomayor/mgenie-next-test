    "description": "The Franklin Liberty Senior Loan ETF (FLRN) is an exchange-traded fund that aims to provide investors with exposure to the senior loan market. Launched by Franklin Templeton Investments, FLRN seeks to track the performance of the Refinitiv/Lipper Senior Loan Index, which includes senior secured loans made to corporations. These loans typically have floating interest rates, making them an appealing option for investors seeking income in a rising interest rate environment. The ETF is designed for those looking to diversify their portfolios with fixed income investments that may have lower correlations to traditional bonds and equities. FLRN invests primarily in senior loans that are rated below investment grade but are senior in the capital structure, providing an opportunity for higher yields compared to traditional fixed-income securities. The fund is particularly suitable for income-focused investors who are aware of the associated risks and are looking for a way to hedge against inflation. With a commitment to transparency and low fees, FLRN is an attractive choice for both individual and institutional investors looking to gain access to the senior loan asset class.",
