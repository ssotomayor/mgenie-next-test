    "description": "The Schwab International Equity ETF (SCZ) is designed to track the performance of the FTSE All-World ex US Index, which includes large and mid-cap stocks from developed and emerging markets outside the United States. Launched in 2008, SCZ provides investors with a way to gain exposure to international equities, offering diversification beyond the U.S. market. The fund invests primarily in companies located in Europe, Asia, and other regions, reflecting a wide array of sectors and industries. With a focus on large and mid-cap companies, SCZ aims to capture the growth potential of foreign markets while maintaining a low expense ratio, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. The fund employs a passive management strategy, which means it seeks to replicate the performance of its benchmark index rather than actively selecting stocks. This approach helps to minimize management fees and transaction costs. The ETF is particularly appealing to those looking to hedge against U.S. market volatility or seeking opportunities in fast-growing international markets. With a strong emphasis on transparency and liquidity, SCZ stands out as a reliable choice for investors aiming to enhance their portfolios with global equity exposure.",
