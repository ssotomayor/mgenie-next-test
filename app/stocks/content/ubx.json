    "description": "Unity Biotechnology, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics to slow, halt, or reverse age-related diseases. Founded in 2017, Unity aims to address the underlying causes of age-related decline by targeting cellular senescence, a key contributor to aging and age-associated diseases. The company is pioneering the development of senolytic therapies, which selectively eliminate senescent cells to promote healthspan and improve the quality of life for the aging population. Unity's lead product candidates, including UBX0101, are being investigated for their potential to treat conditions such as osteoarthritis and other degenerative diseases. The company is committed to advancing the science of aging through rigorous research and innovative approaches, with a vision to transform the way we treat age-related diseases. Unity's platform leverages a diverse array of preclinical and clinical data to identify and develop effective interventions, aiming to bring novel therapies to patients who need them most. As the global demographic shifts towards an older population, Unity is at the forefront of the biopharmaceutical industry, striving to create a healthier future for all individuals as they age.",
