    "description": "Verona Pharma plc is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Founded in 2005, the company is headquartered in London, UK, and aims to address the unmet medical needs of patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Verona Pharma's lead product candidate, ensifentrine, is a dual inhibitor of the enzymes known as the NADPH oxidase and the lipoxygenase pathways, which play a critical role in inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs. This unique mechanism of action positions ensifentrine as a potential first-line treatment for patients with COPD. The company is advancing its clinical trials with promising results and aims for regulatory approval to bring its therapies to market. Verona Pharma is committed to leveraging its expertise in respiratory medicine to develop therapies that improve patient outcomes and quality of life. With a robust pipeline and a focus on innovation, Verona Pharma is poised to make significant contributions to the field of respiratory health.",
