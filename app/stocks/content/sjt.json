    "description": "San Juan Basin Royalty Trust is a publicly traded trust established to own and manage royalties from the production of oil and natural gas in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico. The trust was created in 1980 and has been a means for investors to participate in the revenue generated from these fossil fuel resources without owning the operational aspects of extraction. The primary source of income for the trust comes from royalties on the production of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and crude oil, from the underlying properties. The trust's income is subject to fluctuations based on market prices for oil and gas, production levels, and operational costs. San Juan Basin Royalty Trust distributes a significant portion of its income to unit holders in the form of regular cash distributions, making it an attractive investment for those seeking income from energy resources. Additionally, the trust is managed by a trustee who oversees the operations and ensures that the interests of unit holders are prioritized. Given the ongoing transition towards renewable energy, the trust operates within a unique niche in the energy sector, with its performance closely tied to traditional fossil fuel markets. As the energy landscape evolves, San Juan Basin Royalty Trust remains a key player in providing income derived from oil and natural gas exploration and production activities in the San Juan Basin region.",
