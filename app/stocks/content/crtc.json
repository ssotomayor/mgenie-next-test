    "description": "Cortexyme, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Founded in 2015, Cortexyme focuses on the role of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disorders. The company's lead product candidate, COR388, is an oral small molecule designed to target and inhibit the activity of this bacterium, potentially slowing or halting disease progression. Cortexyme's research is backed by robust scientific evidence suggesting that treating the underlying infection may provide a new therapeutic approach to managing symptoms of Alzheimer's. With a mission to transform the treatment landscape for neurodegenerative diseases, Cortexyme is pioneering a novel strategy that merges insights from microbiology and neurology. The company aims to bring forth new hope for patients and their families by addressing the unmet needs of those affected by debilitating cognitive decline. Cortexyme is committed to advancing its pipeline through clinical trials and collaborating with the broader medical community to validate the role of oral health in overall brain health.",
