    "description": "Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Back Opportunities Fund is a closed-end fund that seeks to provide total return and current income by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities. The fund aims to achieve its investment objective by employing a tax-managed strategy focused on the buy-back opportunities of both large-cap and mid-cap companies. Established by Eaton Vance Management in 2008, this fund is designed to help investors navigate the complexities of capital gains taxes while maximizing their investment returns. The investment team utilizes a rigorous research process to identify companies with strong fundamentals that are actively repurchasing their shares, as these actions often lead to a favorable impact on stock prices. The fund's structure allows it to take advantage of market inefficiencies and deliver income while managing tax implications for its shareholders. By focusing on companies that are committed to returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, the fund aims to enhance the long-term growth potential of its portfolio. Additionally, Eaton Vance is known for its commitment to responsible investing, incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into its investment processes to ensure sustainable value creation.",
