    "description": "The Schwab U.S. Small-Cap Value ETF (SCHV) is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the performance of small-cap value stocks in the U.S. equity market. Launched in 2011 by Charles Schwab Investment Management, SCHV aims to provide investors with exposure to companies that exhibit value characteristics, such as low price-to-earnings ratios and high dividend yields. This ETF invests in a diversified portfolio of small-cap stocks, ensuring a balance between risk and potential returns. The fund is managed with a systematic, rules-based approach, relying on rigorous screening and selection criteria to identify undervalued stocks that have the potential for capital appreciation. SCHV is particularly appealing to long-term investors seeking to capitalize on the growth potential of small-cap companies, which historically have outperformed larger companies over the long term. The fund is known for its low expense ratio, making it a cost-effective choice for investors looking to integrate small-cap value exposure into their portfolios. With a commitment to transparency and efficiency, SCHV provides investors with a convenient way to access the small-cap value segment of the market, contributing to a well-rounded investment strategy.",
