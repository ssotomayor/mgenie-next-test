Founded in 2014 by Trevor Milton, Nikola aims to revolutionize the trucking and commercial vehicle markets by providing zero-emissions solutions that significantly reduce the carbon footprint of freight transport. The company gained attention with its ambitious plans for hydrogen fuel cell technology and electric battery vehicles, including the Nikola Tre, a battery-electric truck designed for regional transport, and the Nikola Two, a hydrogen fuel cell semi-truck built for long-haul routes. Nikola also aims to create a comprehensive infrastructure for hydrogen fueling stations to support its vehicles, facilitating the transition to sustainable transport. The company's mission is to lead the charge towards a sustainable future by harnessing innovative technologies in the automotive industry, contributing to cleaner air and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, Nikola's journey has not been without challenges, including scrutiny over its business practices and technology claims, which the company is striving to overcome as it moves forward with its vision.",
