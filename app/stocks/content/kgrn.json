Launched in 2018, the ETF aims to track the performance of the MSCI China Environment Index, which includes firms engaged in renewable energy, pollution control, waste management, and sustainable agriculture. KGRN offers investors the opportunity to capitalize on China's growing commitment to environmental sustainability and its rapid transition to a greener economy. The fund holds a diversified portfolio of companies that are leading the charge in technologies such as solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, and smart grid solutions. With China being the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the government's initiatives and policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting clean energy make KGRN a strategic investment for those looking to support environmental sustainability while seeking financial returns. The ETF is particularly attractive for investors interested in the intersection of environmental and financial performance, aligning with global trends towards sustainability, climate change mitigation, and energy transition.",
