    "description": "ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF (VIXM) is an exchange-traded fund designed to provide exposure to the performance of the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index. This ETF seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in VIX futures contracts with maturities that are typically between four and seven months. The fund aims to capture the movement of volatility as indicated by the VIX Index, which is a popular measure of market risk and investor sentiment. VIXM is particularly attractive for investors looking to hedge against potential market downturns or to speculate on market volatility. Founded in 2011, ProShares is a pioneer in the field of ETFs and offers a broad range of investment options, including strategies that focus on leverage, inverse performance, and various asset classes. VIXM provides an innovative way for investors to gain exposure to volatility without directly trading futures, making it accessible to a wider audience. The fund's performance may be influenced by factors such as market conditions, investor sentiment, and changes in implied volatility. As with all investments, there are risks involved, and it is important for investors to understand these risks before investing in VIXM.",
