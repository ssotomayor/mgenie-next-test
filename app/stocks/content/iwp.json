Launched in 2000 by BlackRock, Inc., this ETF provides investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to their peers. The fund primarily invests in U.S. companies that exhibit growth characteristics, including strong earnings growth, high price-to-earnings ratios, and significant revenue growth potential. IWP is particularly attractive for investors looking to gain exposure to the innovation and growth potential found in smaller firms, which often lead the way in emerging industries and technologies. The ETF is known for its liquidity and low expense ratio, making it a cost-effective option for both individual and institutional investors. As part of the broader iShares product line, IWP offers a transparent, efficient way to invest in a growth-focused strategy within the small-cap segment of the equity market.",
