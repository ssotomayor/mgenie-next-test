    "description": "Invesco Senior Loan ETF (BKLN) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of senior loans. Launched in 2011, the fund is designed to track the performance of the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index, which includes the largest and most liquid senior loans in the U.S. market. Senior loans are typically issued by below-investment-grade companies, making them attractive to investors seeking higher yields compared to traditional fixed-income securities. BKLN offers a unique investment opportunity by focusing on floating-rate loans, which can provide protection against rising interest rates. The ETF is managed by Invesco, a global investment management firm with a strong reputation in the asset management industry. With its strategic focus on senior loans, BKLN aims to deliver competitive income and total return while mitigating some of the risks associated with fixed-rate bonds. The fund is suitable for investors looking to diversify their fixed-income investments and benefit from the potential for higher yields in a low-interest-rate environment. Furthermore, BKLN has gained popularity among income-focused investors and those seeking to hedge against inflation due to its floating-rate nature, which adjusts as interest rates change.",
