    "description": "ContraFect Corporation is a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative therapies for serious and life-threatening infections. Founded in 2012, the company focuses on harnessing the power of biologics, specifically lysins and monoclonal antibodies, to treat bacterial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. With the rising global concern over antibiotic resistance, ContraFect aims to provide effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics, potentially transforming the treatment landscape for infections. The company's lead product candidates include CF-301, a lysin designed to target and kill Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, and CF-404, an antibody-based treatment for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ContraFect's platform is based on a deep understanding of bacterial cell wall biology and immune evasion, which allows it to develop therapies that not only kill bacteria but also enhance the immune response. The company is committed to addressing unmet medical needs in infectious diseases, and its innovative approach has the potential to significantly impact public health.",
