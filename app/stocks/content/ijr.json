    "description": "The iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) is designed to track the investment results of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities. Launched in 2000, IJR provides investors with exposure to a broad range of small-cap stocks across various sectors that have the potential for growth and appreciation. The ETF is managed by BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s leading asset management firms, and aims to offer a cost-effective way for investors to diversify their portfolios with smaller companies that may not be as widely covered by analysts compared to their large-cap counterparts. IJR\u2019s underlying index, the S&P SmallCap 600, includes companies that meet specific liquidity and financial viability requirements, ensuring that the ETF holds quality businesses. The ETF is popular among both individual and institutional investors looking to gain exposure to small-cap equities, which historically have outperformed large-cap stocks over the long term. By investing in IJR, shareholders can participate in the potential upside of the small-cap segment of the market while benefiting from the liquidity and diversification that an ETF provides. With a low expense ratio, IJR is an attractive option for long-term investors seeking to capitalize on the growth potential of small-cap stocks.",
