    "description": "The Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 ETF (VIOO) is designed to provide investors with exposure to the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. Launched in 2010, this exchange-traded fund seeks to track the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which consists of 600 small-cap companies that meet specific inclusion criteria, including market capitalization and liquidity. VIOO offers a diversified portfolio that spans various sectors, allowing investors to capitalize on growth opportunities within the small-cap market. With its low expense ratio, VIOO aims to provide an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to the small-cap asset class, which historically has demonstrated higher growth potential compared to larger companies, albeit with increased volatility. The ETF is managed by Vanguard, a leader in investment management known for its commitment to low-cost investing and investor education. Through VIOO, investors can participate in the potential upside of small-cap stocks, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios or seek higher returns. The fund's objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation through investments in a broad range of small-cap stocks, reflecting the performance of the U.S. economy at a smaller scale.",
