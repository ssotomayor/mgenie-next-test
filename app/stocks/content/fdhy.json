    "description": "Franklin Liberty High Yield Corporate ETF (FDHY) is a specialized exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of high yield corporate bonds. Managed by Franklin Templeton, a well-respected global investment management firm, FDHY is designed to offer a convenient and cost-effective means for investors to access the high yield bond market. This ETF invests primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds rated below investment grade, which typically offer higher yields than investment-grade securities due to their increased risk of default. The fund aims to generate income while seeking to preserve capital, and it actively manages its portfolio to navigate changing market conditions. The investment strategy includes a focus on credit selection and duration management, leveraging the expertise of Franklin Templeton's credit research team. FDHY is particularly appealing to income-focused investors looking to enhance their portfolio's yield while diversifying their fixed income exposure. With a transparent structure and the flexibility of trading on the stock exchange, FDHY provides an efficient way for investors to participate in the high yield bond market. The fund's distribution of income is typically paid monthly, making it an attractive option for those seeking regular income streams.",
