    "description": "Wrap Technologies, Inc. is a public safety technology company that develops innovative solutions to enhance community safety and law enforcement operations. Founded in 2016, Wrap is best known for its flagship product, the BolaWrap, a remote restraint device designed to safely subdue individuals from a distance, thereby minimizing the need for physical force. The company aims to provide law enforcement agencies with tools that can help reduce the use of traditional force and improve the safety of both officers and civilians. The BolaWrap device is designed to deploy a tethered, nylon cord that wraps around a subject's body, allowing for a safe and effective means of restraint without causing harm. Wrap Technologies is also committed to ongoing training and support for law enforcement agencies to ensure the effective use of its products. Besides the BolaWrap, the company is dedicated to continuous research and development in non-lethal technologies for public safety enhancement. Wrap Technologies believes that the future of policing lies in the implementation of innovative, non-lethal tools that prioritize de-escalation and community trust.",
