    "description": "Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is a publicly traded trust that was formed to provide a vehicle for investors to participate in the cash flow generated from oil and gas production. Established in 1991, the trust primarily holds royalty interests in various oil and gas properties located in the United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. The trust receives monthly distributions based on the proceeds from these properties, which are managed by a designated trustee. Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is known for its stable income potential, primarily driven by its production of oil and natural gas. The trust aims to offer investors a reliable income stream while benefiting from the long-term appreciation of the underlying assets. With an operational focus on optimizing production and managing costs, the trust seeks to enhance value for its unitholders. The company operates in the energy sector, navigating the complexities of the oil and gas market, including price fluctuations and production levels. As a passive entity, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust does not engage in active oil and gas exploration but rather capitalizes on its existing interests to generate revenue for its investors. The trust's commitment to transparency and regular reporting allows investors to stay informed about performance metrics and distribution amounts, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors.",
