Founded in 2014 and based in Redwood City, California, the company focuses on targeting the RAS pathway, a major driver of cancer progression that has been notoriously difficult to drug. Revolution Medicines utilizes a unique approach called 'Ras-targeted therapy', which aims to address the fundamental genetic mutations that are responsible for a wide range of cancers. The company's lead program, RMC-4630, is a selective inhibitor of SHP2, a key protein that modulates RAS signaling. Additionally, Revolution Medicines is advancing several other programs that target RAS and its downstream signaling pathways. The company is committed to transforming the treatment of cancer through innovative therapies that not only improve patient outcomes but also enhance quality of life. With a strong pipeline and strategic collaborations, Revolution Medicines is well-positioned to make significant contributions to the field of oncology.",
