    "description": "Aileron Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing innovative therapeutics to improve the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Founded in 2008, Aileron is pioneering the use of stapled peptide technology, which enables the creation of peptide-based drugs that can effectively target intracellular proteins. This technology has the potential to unlock new therapeutic options for diseases that have previously been challenging to treat with conventional small molecules or biologics. Aileron's lead candidate, ALRN-6924, is designed to inhibit the MDM2 and MDMX proteins, which are known to play a critical role in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. By restoring the function of p53, ALRN-6924 aims to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, offering a new approach to oncology treatment. The company is dedicated to advancing its pipeline through clinical trials and is committed to making a significant impact on patient outcomes. With a team of experienced scientists and industry veterans, Aileron Therapeutics strives to address unmet medical needs and provide hope to patients facing serious health challenges.",
