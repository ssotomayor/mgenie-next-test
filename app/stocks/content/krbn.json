    "description": "KraneShares Global Carbon ETF (KRBN) is an innovative exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with exposure to the global carbon credit market. Launched in 2020 by KraneShares, a leading provider of China-focused ETFs, KRBN aims to capitalize on the growing importance of carbon emissions trading as a mechanism for combating climate change. The fund seeks to track the performance of the IHS Markit Global Carbon Index, which includes carbon credit futures contracts from various international markets, including the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and California's Cap-and-Trade Program. By investing in KRBN, investors can gain access to a diversified portfolio of carbon credits, which represent permits allowing the holder to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. The fund is part of a broader trend towards sustainable investing, as more companies and governments commit to reducing their carbon footprints and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. KraneShares emphasizes transparency and education, providing resources for investors to better understand the dynamics of the carbon market, its regulatory landscape, and the potential impact of climate policies. As global awareness of climate change increases, KRBN positions itself as a crucial tool for investors looking to align their portfolios with environmentally responsible practices while potentially benefiting from the growth of the carbon market.",
