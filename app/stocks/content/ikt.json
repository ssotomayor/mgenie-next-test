    "description": "Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those related to Parkinson's disease. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, IKT is dedicated to advancing treatments that address the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. The company's lead product candidate, IkT-148009, is designed to inhibit the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein that plays a significant role in the progression of Parkinson's disease. This novel approach aims to modify the disease's trajectory rather than merely alleviate symptoms. Inhibikase is committed to conducting rigorous clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its therapies, with the goal of bringing new hope to patients suffering from debilitating neurological disorders. The company is also exploring additional therapeutic avenues for other conditions associated with synucleinopathies. With a strong focus on research and development, Inhibikase is poised to make significant contributions to the field of neurotherapeutics, potentially transforming the lives of millions affected by these challenging diseases.",
