    "description": "Aileron Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing a novel class of therapeutics called stapled peptides. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Aileron is dedicated to addressing significant unmet medical needs in cancer and other diseases. The company has developed a proprietary technology platform that allows for the design and development of stapled peptides that can modulate protein-protein interactions, which are crucial in various biological processes. Aileron's lead product candidate, ALRN-6924, is aimed at treating cancers characterized by the loss of the p53 tumor suppressor function. The therapy has shown promising results in early clinical trials, demonstrating the potential to restore the activity of p53 and induce tumor cell death. Aileron is also exploring other applications of its stapled peptide technology in different therapeutic areas, including metabolic and autoimmune diseases. With a strong pipeline and a commitment to innovation, Aileron Therapeutics is positioned at the forefront of peptide-based therapeutic advancements, striving to improve patient outcomes through targeted treatment strategies.",
