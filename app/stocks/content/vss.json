    "description": "The Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VSS) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Small Cap Value Index. This index is designed to measure the investment return of small-capitalization value stocks in the United States, which are characterized by lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth rates. The ETF was launched by Vanguard, one of the largest investment management companies in the world, known for its commitment to low-cost investing. Through VSS, investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of small-cap value stocks, which can provide significant opportunities for capital appreciation over the long term. The fund holds a wide range of stocks across various sectors, including financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary. Vanguard's rigorous research and investment strategies aim to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns while minimizing costs. This ETF is suitable for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with small-cap value investments, which historically have the potential for higher returns compared to large-cap stocks. Additionally, VSS is designed for long-term investors who are willing to accept short-term volatility in exchange for potential long-term growth.",
