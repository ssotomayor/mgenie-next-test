    "description": "Cortexyme, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Founded in 2015, Cortexyme is at the forefront of research aimed at understanding the role of pathogens in the progression of neurodegeneration, particularly focusing on the impact of the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis. The company's lead product candidate, atuzaginstat (COR388), is designed to inhibit the activity of this bacterium, potentially addressing the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease rather than merely treating symptoms. Cortexyme's approach is supported by a growing body of scientific evidence linking oral health, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. The company is committed to advancing its pipeline through robust clinical trials and collaborations with leading academic institutions and research organizations. Cortexyme aims to provide new hope for patients and families affected by Alzheimer's and similar conditions, striving to create effective therapies that can significantly alter the course of these diseases. With a passionate team of scientists and industry veterans, Cortexyme is positioned to make meaningful contributions to the field of neurology and improve outcomes for patients worldwide.",
