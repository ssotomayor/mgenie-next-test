    "description": "Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic and debilitating conditions. Founded in 1992, Titan specializes in the development of its proprietary drug delivery system, ProNeura, which utilizes a small implantable device to provide continuous drug delivery over extended periods. This technology is particularly beneficial for patients with substance use disorders, as it allows for long-term treatment without the need for daily dosing. Titan's lead product, Probuphine, is a sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine designed for the treatment of opioid dependence. The company is dedicated to addressing the challenges associated with addiction and is committed to improving the quality of life for patients through its advanced therapeutic solutions. In addition to Probuphine, Titan is exploring additional product candidates and applications for its ProNeura technology, including treatments for chronic pain and other conditions. Titan Pharmaceuticals is headquartered in South San Francisco, California, and continues to engage in ongoing research and development to expand its portfolio and reach more patients in need.",
