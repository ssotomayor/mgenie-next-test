    "description": "Wave Life Sciences Ltd. is a clinical-stage genetic medicine company focused on developing transformative therapies for patients with genetic diseases. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Wave leverages its proprietary platform to design and develop a new class of medicines known as stereopure oligonucleotides. These molecules are engineered to be highly specific, allowing for precise modulation of gene expression, making them a promising approach for treating various genetic disorders. The company's lead programs target rare diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and other neuromuscular conditions, as well as certain types of cancer. Wave\u2019s innovative approach aims to address the underlying genetic causes of these diseases rather than merely alleviating symptoms. With a strong emphasis on scientific excellence and collaboration, Wave is committed to advancing its pipeline through rigorous clinical development and partnerships. The company strives to bring hope to patients and their families by developing therapies that are safe, effective, and transformative.",
