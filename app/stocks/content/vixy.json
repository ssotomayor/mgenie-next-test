    "description": "ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investors with exposure to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear index.' The VIX measures market expectations of near-term volatility, derived from the prices of S&P 500 index options. Launched in 2011, VIXY invests primarily in short-term VIX futures contracts, aiming to deliver returns that correspond to the performance of the VIX over time. This ETF is designed for investors looking to hedge against market downturns or to speculate on volatility, as it typically rises when equity markets decline. VIXY is suited for short-term trading strategies and investors seeking to manage risk in a volatile market environment. The fund is managed by ProShares, a leader in the ETF industry known for its innovative products. VIXY allows investors to gain exposure to volatility without directly trading futures contracts, making it more accessible for retail investors. However, it's important to note that investing in VIXY carries risks, including the potential for significant losses, especially in times of low volatility. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before investing in volatility-based products.",
