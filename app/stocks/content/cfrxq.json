    "description": "ContraFect Corporation is a biotechnology company focused on the development of innovative therapies for serious infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Founded in 2012, the company is headquartered in Yonkers, New York. ContraFect is pioneering the use of lysins, which are enzymes derived from bacteriophages, to treat bacterial infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other multi-drug resistant pathogens. Their lead product candidate, CF-301, is currently in clinical trials and has shown promise as a potential treatment for serious skin infections. The company's mission is to address the growing public health crisis of antibiotic resistance by providing effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics. ContraFect's research and development efforts are supported by a strong intellectual property portfolio and collaborations with academic institutions and industry partners. The increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria highlights the urgent need for new treatment options, positioning ContraFect as a crucial player in the biopharmaceutical sector. With a commitment to innovation and patient care, ContraFect aims to deliver transformative therapies that can save lives and improve health outcomes in the face of antibiotic resistance.",
