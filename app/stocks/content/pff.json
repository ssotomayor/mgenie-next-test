    "description": "Invesco Preferred Fund (PFF) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that primarily invests in preferred securities issued by various corporations. Launched in 2007, PFF seeks to track the performance of the ICE BofA US Preferred Stock Index, which is comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated preferred securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.

The fund's holdings include a mix of investment-grade and high-yield preferred stocks, spanning multiple sectors such as financials, utilities, and telecommunications. PFF aims to provide investors with a steady stream of income through its monthly distributions, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. The fund is managed by Invesco, a global investment management firm known for its extensive range of investment products and services. With a focus on risk management and performance, PFF is designed to appeal to both retail and institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios with preferred securities.",
