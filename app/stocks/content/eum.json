Launched in 2007, EUM aims to deliver twice the inverse performance of the index on a daily basis, allowing investors to hedge their portfolios or speculate on market downturns. The fund primarily invests in a range of derivatives, including swaps and futures, to achieve its investment objective.

As an investment vehicle, EUM is often utilized by traders looking for short-term opportunities or those seeking to manage risks associated with their broader equity investments.
