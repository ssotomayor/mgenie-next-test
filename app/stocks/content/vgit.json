This ETF aims to offer investors a way to gain access to a diversified portfolio of U.S. Treasury bonds, which are considered some of the safest investments available. VGIT seeks to track the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Government Intermediate Index, which includes U.S. Treasuries that are issued by the federal government. By investing in VGIT, investors can benefit from interest income while potentially reducing portfolio volatility, as government bonds often provide a stabilizing effect during market downturns.
