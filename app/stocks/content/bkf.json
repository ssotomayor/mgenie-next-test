The fund primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of U.S. large-cap stocks, utilizing a covered call strategy aimed at enhancing income while providing equity market exposure. Established to meet the needs of investors seeking both growth and income, BKF employs an investment approach that seeks to generate consistent returns through both capital appreciation and option premiums.
