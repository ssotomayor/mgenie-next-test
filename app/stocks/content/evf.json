    "description": "Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Income Trust (EVF) is a closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of current income by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of floating-rate loans and other floating-rate instruments. The trust was established to capitalize on the opportunities presented by a rising interest rate environment, offering investors a way to gain exposure to floating-rate securities that may benefit from interest rate increases. Managed by Eaton Vance, a well-respected investment management firm, EVF aims to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns through an active management strategy. The portfolio typically includes senior secured loans made to corporations, which are often considered to be higher quality and less risky compared to other types of debt instruments. With a focus on credit quality and rigorous research, the management team strives to select securities that align with the trust's income objectives while managing potential risks. In addition to floating-rate loans, EVF may also invest in other fixed-income securities, including high-yield bonds and investment-grade bonds, to diversify its portfolio and enhance income. The trust pays monthly distributions to its shareholders, making it an appealing option for income-seeking investors.",
