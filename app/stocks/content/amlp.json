The fund\u2019s holdings are mainly concentrated in the oil and gas industry, including companies that operate pipelines and other critical energy infrastructure. As a passively managed fund, AMLP also provides a cost-effective way to participate in the MLP space while benefiting from the potential growth of the energy sector.
