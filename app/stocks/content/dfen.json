Launched by Direxion, a well-known provider of leveraged and inverse ETFs, DFEN aims to deliver three times the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index. This fund is designed for traders and investors looking to capitalize on short-term movements within the aerospace and defense industries, which have been experiencing significant growth due to increased defense budgets and advancements in technology. DFEN invests in stocks of companies engaged in the research, development, and manufacturing of products and services related to aerospace and defense. With a focus on high-growth, high-potential firms, the fund includes a diverse array of companies, from major defense contractors to emerging aerospace innovators. However, due to its leveraged nature, DFEN is intended for sophisticated investors who are prepared for the risks associated with daily trading and market volatility.
