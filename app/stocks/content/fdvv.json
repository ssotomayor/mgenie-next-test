    "description": "The Fidelity Momentum Factor ETF (FDVV) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide investment results that correspond to the performance of the Fidelity Momentum Factor Index. Launched by Fidelity Investments, this ETF focuses on companies that exhibit strong price momentum, aiming to capture the upward trends in stock prices. The fund is designed for investors looking to capitalize on the momentum strategy, which has been a popular approach among growth investors. By investing in FDVV, shareholders gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities that are selected based on their historical price performance and other momentum indicators. The ETF is rebalanced quarterly to ensure that it maintains its focus on the most dynamic stocks in the market. Fidelity's expertise in asset management is leveraged to monitor and adjust the portfolio, making it a potentially attractive option for those seeking capital appreciation over time.
