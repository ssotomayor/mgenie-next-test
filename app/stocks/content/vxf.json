    "description": "The Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF) is an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to the performance of mid-cap and small-cap U.S. stocks, excluding the largest companies represented in the S&P 500. Launched in 2001, VXF is designed to complement broad market exposure by capturing the performance of the U.S. equity market outside of the large-cap segment. The fund holds thousands of individual stocks across various sectors, making it a diversified option for investors looking to tap into the growth potential of smaller companies. VXF aims to track the performance of the CRSP US Mid Cap Index and the CRSP US Small Cap Index, delivering a cost-effective way to invest in both mid-cap and small-cap segments of the market. With a focus on low expense ratios, Vanguard aims to help investors keep more of their returns. The fund is suitable for investors who are looking to diversify their equity holdings beyond large-cap stocks and want to add exposure to the broader U.S. stock market, while also benefiting from the potential for higher growth from smaller companies. Vanguard is known for its investor-first approach and commitment to providing low-cost investment options, making VXF a viable choice for both individual and institutional investors alike.",
