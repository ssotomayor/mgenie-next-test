    "description": "The Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHZ) is designed to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index. Launched by Charles Schwab Investment Management, SCHZ provides investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of large-cap U.S. stocks, representing a significant portion of the U.S. equity market. The ETF invests in companies across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer goods, and financials, making it a comprehensive choice for investors seeking broad market exposure. With a low expense ratio, SCHZ appeals to cost-conscious investors while providing the potential for capital appreciation and income through dividends. The fund employs a passive investment strategy, aiming to replicate the performance of its benchmark index rather than actively selecting individual stocks. This approach allows for greater transparency and lower fees. As a part of the Charles Schwab family of funds, SCHZ also benefits from the firm's reputation for customer service and investor education. The ETF is suitable for long-term investors seeking to build wealth through diversified equity exposure, making it a popular choice for retirement accounts and taxable brokerage accounts alike. SCHZ's performance is closely monitored by investors, and it is often used as a core holding in a well-balanced investment portfolio.",
