Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Athira leverages its proprietary platform to discover and develop small molecule therapies aimed at restoring neuronal function and improving cognitive health. The company's lead candidate, ATH-1017, is designed to enhance the activity of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) pathway, a critical mechanism in neuroprotection and neurogenesis. Athira is committed to addressing the significant unmet medical need in neurodegenerative conditions, where current treatment options are limited and often do not address the underlying causes of cognitive decline. With a strong pipeline and dedicated team of scientists and clinicians, Athira aims to bring hope to patients and families affected by these debilitating diseases. The company is actively engaged in clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its therapeutic candidates, and it is focused on advancing its research to potentially provide new solutions for patients suffering from cognitive impairments.",
