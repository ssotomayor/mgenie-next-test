    "description": "The Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (FNDX) is an exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with exposure to the performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index. This index includes a wide range of stocks, primarily within the technology sector, but also covers various industries such as consumer services, healthcare, and financials. The ETF was launched by Fidelity Investments, a renowned asset management firm founded in 1946, known for its commitment to innovation and investor education. FNDX aims to replicate the performance of the index through a passive investment strategy, which means it holds the same securities as the index in approximately the same proportions. This approach allows investors to benefit from the growth potential of the tech-heavy Nasdaq while maintaining diversification across multiple sectors. The fund is particularly attractive to investors looking for long-term growth and exposure to high-growth companies, including many of the world\u2019s leading technology firms. FNDX also features a low expense ratio compared to actively managed funds, making it a cost-effective option for investors seeking to gain exposure to the dynamic Nasdaq market. With its focus on transparency and liquidity, FNDX is an appealing choice for both individual and institutional investors seeking to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks that reflect the performance of the broader Nasdaq Composite.",
