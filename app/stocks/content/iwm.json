    "description": "The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities, specifically the Russell 2000 Index. Launched in 2000 and managed by BlackRock, Inc., this ETF provides investors with exposure to the performance of 2,000 small-cap stocks in the U.S. equity market, which represent approximately 10% of the total U.S. stock market capitalization. The fund aims to capture the potential growth of smaller companies, which often have high growth rates and can outperform larger stocks during various market cycles. IWM is designed for investors looking for diversification, as it holds a wide array of companies from various sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and financial services. The ETF is particularly popular among investors who believe in the long-term growth potential of small-cap stocks and want a cost-effective way to invest in this segment of the market. Being passively managed, IWM has a low expense ratio, making it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors seeking broad exposure to U.S. small-cap stocks. The fund also offers liquidity and flexibility, as shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day on the stock exchange.",
