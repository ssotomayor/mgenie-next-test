    "description": "The Invesco S&P SmallCap Health Care ETF (PSCH) is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to track the investment results of the S&P SmallCap 600\u00ae Health Care Index. This index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. health care sector and includes companies that are involved in various aspects of the health care industry, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and health care providers. Launched in 2006, PSCH provides investors with exposure to small-cap health care companies, which are often positioned for growth due to their innovative products and services. The ETF aims to offer a diversified investment option that captures the potential of emerging health care companies while managing risks associated with smaller firms. Investors in PSCH benefit from the strategic allocation to companies that could be key players in advancements in health care, including those involved in research and development, manufacturing, and distribution of health care products. By focusing on small-cap companies, the ETF can potentially deliver higher returns, albeit with increased volatility compared to large-cap health care funds. With a low expense ratio and a commitment to tracking its benchmark index closely, PSCH is a compelling choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with a focus on the health care sector.",
