    "description": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates international trade. Established on January 1, 1995, it succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and aims to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible. The WTO provides a framework for negotiating trade agreements, resolving trade disputes, and monitoring national trade policies. With 164 member countries, the organization plays a crucial role in facilitating cooperation among nations to promote economic growth and development through trade. The WTO's core functions include administering trade agreements, acting as a forum for trade negotiations, providing technical assistance and training for developing countries, and conducting trade policy reviews. The organization also addresses issues related to global economic governance, trade and environment, trade and development, and the impact of trade on poverty reduction. The WTO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and its activities are governed by a Ministerial Conference, which meets every two years, and a General Council that meets more frequently to oversee the day-to-day work of the organization. By promoting a rules-based trading system, the WTO seeks to enhance the welfare of people worldwide and foster an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth.",
