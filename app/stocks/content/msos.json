    "description": "The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (MSOS) is an exchange-traded fund that aims to provide investors with exposure to the rapidly growing cannabis industry. Launched in 2020, this actively managed ETF primarily invests in U.S.-based companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from the cannabis sector. With the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use across various states in the U.S., the cannabis market has seen substantial growth, and MSOS seeks to capitalize on this trend by investing in companies involved in cultivation, distribution, and ancillary services related to cannabis. The fund is managed by a team of experienced investment professionals who employ a rigorous research process to identify and select high-quality companies in the cannabis space. MSOS has gained attention for its focus on companies that are legally operating within the U.S. market, as well as its dynamic approach to portfolio management, allowing for adjustments based on market conditions and opportunities. The ETF provides investors with a diversified way to participate in the cannabis industry's growth without needing to pick individual stocks. As the cannabis landscape continues to evolve, MSOS aims to deliver long-term capital appreciation while navigating the complexities of this emerging sector.",
