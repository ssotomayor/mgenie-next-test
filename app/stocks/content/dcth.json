    "description": "Delcath Systems, Inc. is a specialized medical device company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. Founded in 1988, Delcath has developed a proprietary system known as the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System, which is designed to deliver high doses of chemotherapy directly to the liver while minimizing systemic exposure. This innovative approach allows for targeted treatment, reducing potential side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy methods. Delcath's unique technology is based on a combination of regional chemotherapy and advanced filtration techniques, enabling the removal of the chemotherapy agent from the blood before it circulates throughout the body. The company is committed to advancing the field of oncology through its research and clinical programs, aiming to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Delcath has pursued regulatory approvals and collaborations to expand the use of its technology in treating various liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic tumors. Additionally, Delcath is focused on further developing its platform to explore other potential indications and applications in the field of interventional oncology, highlighting its dedication to innovation in cancer treatment.",
